# Alterforms
Custom Module for Drupal 8

## Description
Custom Module for Drupal 8: getting the form ID by messages and changes through hooks like form_alter or FORM_ID_alter.

## Purpose
This module is only for development environments (disable / uninstall before moving to other environments).

## Context
Do you want to make changes to a form in Drupal 8 and you need to extract its form ID? This module, once installed and activated, configures a Drupal style message with the id of each form that appears on your website. Only when you open it will you be able to see its ID in the header.
